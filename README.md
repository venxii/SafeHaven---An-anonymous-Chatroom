<h1>SafeHaven - Witness Protection Web Application</h1>
<p>The web application that we are working on is called SafeHaven Shield. The basic idea of this web application is to provide shelter to victims or witnesses of a crime by providing them access to lawyers and legal advisers from reputed firms so that they are not vulnerable after disclosing the crime in public. 
</p>
<p>This web application is going to be a chatroom. The witnesses do not have to enter any personal details to be using this application. Whatever information they give out in the chatroom is at their own discretion.
</p>
<p> The lawyers are going to be recognised by the witnesses only as a member of the firm. Their license is not going to be saved in our database to maintain privacy and security.
</p>
<p>One of the primary challenges witnesses face is the harm after disclosing information about a crime. This fear can stem from various sources, including threats from perpetrators, concerns about personal safety, or worries about potential legal repercussions. Additionally, witnesses may face intimidation, coercion, or pressure to remain silent, further complicating their decision to come forward.
</p>
<p>Moreover, witnesses often grapple with the emotional and psychological toll of their experiences, including trauma, stress, and anxiety. They may also encounter practical obstacles such as navigating the legal system, understanding their rights, or accessing resources for support and protection.
</p>
<p>This web application focuses on these witnesses who need guidance to figure out their next move and having an application where they can safely communicate with lawyers without disclosing their identity and without letting the perpetrators know their next move.
